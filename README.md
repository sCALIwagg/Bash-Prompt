# Bash-Prompt
Just some notes and code i'll write for customizing my bash

The "bash prompt.txt" is just a notepad i used to create a template of code I could read with the coresponding shell prompt text colors. 
I find the syntax to be chaotic _-

Next I'll add the aliases I use in shell with PII subbed.
